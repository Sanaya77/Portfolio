            <h2>My first publication on IoT-based electric motors: An incredible experience!</h2>
            <p class="date">September 17, 2024</p>
            <img src="https://www.technology-innovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IoT-A-revolution-in-the-automobile-industry.jpg" alt="Post Image">
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly transformed various industries, and its integration with electric motors is paving the way for smarter, more efficient technologies. IoT-based electric motors, particularly in applications like **C-V2X** (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) and **V2V** (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), enable real-time communication and data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and other connected devices. These innovations allow electric motors in vehicles to operate more efficiently, with features like predictive maintenance, optimized energy consumption, and enhanced safety. </p>

            <h2>Work of consistency: A hackethon to remember!</h2>
            <p class="date">May 22, 2024</p>
            <img src="https://techeela.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hackathons-1.jpg" alt="Post Image">
            <p>My first hackathon was an exciting and rewarding experience, where my team developed a healthcare-based application. We aimed to create a platform that could streamline patient data management, provide real-time health monitoring, and improve communication between patients and healthcare providers. Collaborating under time constraints, we utilized various technologies to integrate features like secure data storage, appointment scheduling, and virtual consultations. The hackathon taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, problem-solving, and rapid prototyping, and it was inspiring to see how technology can be harnessed to make a positive impact in the healthcare industry.</p>
